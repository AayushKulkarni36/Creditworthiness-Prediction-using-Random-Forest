#  Creditworthiness Prediction using Random Forest

This project predicts whether a person is creditworthy (i.e., likely to repay a loan) based on their financial and personal attributes using a machine learning algorithm — **Random Forest Classifier**.

> Developed as part of an internship assignment at **Celebal Technologies**.

##  Project Overview

Credit risk assessment is a crucial part of financial decision-making. This project uses a supervised classification model to predict whether an individual is a **good** or **bad** credit risk based on historical financial data.

##  Dataset Information

- **Source**: [UCI German Credit Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/144/statlog+german+credit+data)
- **Records**: 1000 individuals
- **Attributes**: 20 financial/personal features (age, employment, savings, etc.)
- **Target**: Credit Risk — `1` (Good) or `2` (Bad) → Converted to binary (`1` and `0`)

---
##  Machine Learning Workflow

We use the **Random Forest Classifier**, a powerful ensemble learning technique that reduces variance and improves predictive accuracy.

###  Steps Followed:
1. Convert raw data (`german.data`) to CSV format
2. Preprocess the dataset:
   - Label encode categorical columns
   - Convert target to binary
3. Split into training & testing sets (80/20)
4. Train using `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn
5. Evaluate model performance
6. Visualize feature importances

##  Model Performance

-  **Accuracy**: ~80.5%
-  **Confusion Matrix**:

- **Classification Report**:
- Precision for class `1`: 82%
- Precision for class `0`: 74%

 **Insight**:  
The model performs well, especially for predicting good credit risk (`1`). It slightly underperforms on class `0` due to class imbalance, which is a common challenge in such datasets.
